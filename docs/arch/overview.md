## Open Points

- Which component should measure ambient temperature?
    - Include in U/I Measurement?
    - Include in T measurement of Battery?
    - Create new component?
- PC software supervision?
    - e.g. WDOG functionality?
    - Which component should be supervising?
    - PC is not safety relevant at the moment. (Note from PaGu point of view: It
      is not planned to be safety relevant in the future. Is it worth adding the
      feature? Team discussion + decision is desired.)
- How much redundancy is required for safety relevant parts?
    - Redundant battery temperature measurement?
- CMOS or TTL logic level?
    - choose logic [family][7400-families] used for all components
    - Note from PaGu: choose CMOS logic (supply voltage not limited to 5V)? E.g.
        HC or HCT series.
- Limiting Logic of PSS, "soft" vs "hard" limiting? (Note from PaGu: Consult Mr.
    Rumschinski for opinion, see paper notes from PaGu -> Team decision desired)
    - "soft" limit: change reference value (ger.: Führungsgröße) to limited
        value, if limit is reached. Control circuit experiences jump in
        reference value and controls output accordingly.
    - "hard" limit: reference value of controller is unchanged if limit is
        reached. Output of control circuit is overridden if limit is reached.
