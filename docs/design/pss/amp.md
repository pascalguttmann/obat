# Linear Amplifier

The considered benefits of using a linear amplifier over using a switching
amplifier are:

Advantages:

- easy to control electronically
- fast response time
- stable very low ripple output
- no switched elements with high EMR

Disadvantages:

- low efficiency for large voltage drops and large currents
- requires cooling
